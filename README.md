# ueimporter

`ueimporter` is a command line tool that imports
[Unreal Engine](https://www.unrealengine.com) source code releases
into a [plastic scm](https://www.plasticscm.com) repo,
by replicating changes from the official
[UnrealEngine git repo](https://github.com/EpicGames/UnrealEngine).

## Overview

`ueimporter` is useful for plastic version control users, that wants to
build a game using Unreal Engine, and plan to make changes to the engine code
itself, while also upgrading engine releases as they are released by Epic.

The idea is to see Unreal Engine as a third party vendor lib (albeit a really
big library). An established strategy for vendor libs is to keep a clean and
unmodified copy of the lib in a separate branch, that you merge into the
branch where you do your active development.
`ueimporter` helps create such a vendor branch, and keep it updated with
the vanilla engine for new releases.

A naive strategy would be to delete all files on the vendor branch simply
copy all files from the new release, and let plastic detect which files have
been added, removed, modified or moved.

It sounds like it should work, but the move detection in plastic seem to miss
most moves, at least when there are as many files involved as there are in an
unreal engine upgrade (4.27.2 -> 5.0.0-early-access-1 modifies over 50k files).
For a moved file you will end up with a delete followed by an add. If you have
made changes to the file in the old location on your main-branch you will miss
these when you merge down the new UE release from the vendor branch.
If plastic would know that a file was in fact moved it would be able to merge
your changes into the new location.

This move file problem is the main reason `ueimporter` exist, and to solve it
it uses information from the git repo that knows how and where a file was moved.
It simply asks git `git diff --name-status <from-release-tag> <to-release-tag>`
and we get a list of exactly which files was added, removed, modified or moved.
Once it knows it's just a question of replicating these exact changes
in plastic.

`ueimporter` is meant to be platform independent and could be used on
Windows, macOs or Linux. These platforms disagree on how line endings is encoded
in text files. The tool avoids the problem completely by not copying files
directly from the git repo, rather it expects you to download the zip files
that Epic publish for each engine release, and copies files from there.
Release zips use LF line endings.

We also have file permissions to take into account, There are many
shell scripts targeting Linux and macOs in Unreal Engine, these needs to be checked
into plastic with the `+x` flag set, or else non-windows users will have to manually
`chmod +x` the script files before they can be used.
This means that `ueimporter` **needs to be executed on Linux or macOs** so that
plastic has a chance to read file permission flags from the file system when files
are checked in.

# Suggested branch layout <a name="branch-layout" />

![Branch Layout ](/ueimporter/images/ueimporter-branch-layout-4.27.0-4.27.2.png)

Here we see a suggested branch layout. The game itself is developed on `main`
, on `vendor-unreal-engine` we keep unmodified Unreal Engine releases and finally
there is a couple of task branches called `upgrade-ue-4.27.1` and `upgrade-ue-4.27.2`
used as a staging area for updating `main` with corresponding engine releases.

In this example, the first changesets contains change unrelated to Unreal Engine, in fact after
the second changeset there is not a single file from the engine present.

From this "empty" state we create the `vendor-unreal-engine` branch, and the first commit to it is
a simple copy paste of the all files found in [4.27.0-release.tar.gz](https://github.com/EpicGames/UnrealEngine/releases/tag/4.27.0-release).
Make sure to add and check in files on either macOs or Linux so that any file permission flags
(+x) gets included.

Now we are ready to merge this change down to `main`, and we can start developing our game. We can
even make changes to `Engine` if we need to, such as local change #1.

When we are ready to upgrade to `4.27.1` we switch back to `vendor-unreal-engine`, download
[4.27.1-release.tar.gz](https://github.com/EpicGames/UnrealEngine/releases/tag/4.27.1-release), clone/fetch
the main [UnrealEngine git repo](https://github.com/EpicGames/UnrealEngine) and use
`ueimporter` to replicate all changes to your plastic workspace. Review the result
in plastics UI and check in the result. See [Usage](#usage) for a more detailed description.

Now, we create a branch called `upgrade-ue-4.27.1`, and we merge with the `4.27.1` release
we just imported. Solving any conflicts that `local change #1` might have triggered.
When we test out our game we notice that we need to do `local change #2` to make it work.

The result is merged back to `main` and we can continue developing our game.
Once again, we can make changes to engine code, such as `local change #3`

Whenever it's time to upgrade we rince and repeat the same process;
First we import changes using `ueimporter`, then merge with main on a task branch
before we publish it to `main`.


## Prequestives <a name="prequestives" />
* Python 3.10+
* Git
* [Plastic scm](https://www.plasticscm.com)
Plastics CLI tool `cm` needs to be present in `PATH`
* A clone of the [UnrealEngine git repo](https://github.com/EpicGames/UnrealEngine).
Your github user will need to be a registered unreal developer to get access.
* A release zip for the UE release you want to import.
As listed here [UnrealEngine/releases](https://github.com/EpicGames/UnrealEngine/releases)

## Installation <a name="install" />

Install a snapshot of `ueimporter` using `pip`, from the git repo root
```
$ pip install --user .
```
This enables you to invoke `ueimporter` from any directory (such as the target
plastic repo root)

Each time you want to upgrade `ueimporter` you simply pull down the latest code
and run the command again.

### Uninstall <a name="install-uninstall" />
To uninstall you simply call pip, can be invoked from anywhere:
```
$ pip uninstall ueimporter
```

### Development mode <a name="install-dev-mode" />

If you plan do do active development of `ueimporter` it's more convenient to
install in editable/development mode. This way `pip` installs thin
wrappers in it's registry that simply forwards all invocations to the code
in your git repository.

Again, from your git repo root
```
$ pip install --user -e .
```

## Usage <a name="usage" />

TODO:
* Desc how to sync UE github repo
* Desc branch setup in plastic

Step by step guide:
1. Checkout the vendor branch
2. Make sure the workspace is completely clean (no private/ignored files)
3. Download release zip
4. Run script with --pretend

Here's an example that upgrade a UE vendor branch to `4.27.2`.
```
ueimporter
 --git-repo-root="H:\UnrealEngine"
 --to-release-tag="4.27.2-release"
 --zip-package-root="H:\Vendor\UnrealEngine"
 --plastic-workspace-root="H:\Goals\Game"
 --pretend
```
The `--pretend` argument makes the script simply log the files it will upgrade,
without actually doing it. Remove this parameter once you feel confident
that 'ueimporter' will do what you expect.

5. Run script for real

6. Verify that directory structure is identical to the release zip
7. Check in all changes into plastic
8. Rejoice

## Development <a name="dev" />

Make sure to install `ueimporter` in dev mode, as described [above](#install-dev-mode).

### Debugging <a name="dev-debug" />
To debug you can use pythons build in `pdb` module

```
$ cd ueimporter
$ python -m pdb ueimporter\main.py $(YOUR_OPTIONS)
```

Describing how to use `pdb` is out of scope, for starters try the `help` command.
For more info see the module documentation: [pdb â€” The Python Debugger](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pdb.html)

### Testing <a name="dev-test" />

`ueimporter` use [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org) to run unit tests, it's
automatically installed when you install `ueimporter` with `pip`.

It's simple to use, again from the repo root:
```
# Run all tests
$ pytest

# Run a specific test-file (tests/test_path_util.py)
$ pytest -q test_path_util.py

```

Note that test coverage is not that high at the time of writing.
